#Animation Frame Rate v1.1
#----------#
#Features: Make animations play at a faster rate allowing smoother animations
#           and now allowing animations to play behind their targets.
#
#Usage:    Place #number in the name of any animation you want to change the
#           frame rate of (i.e. #1)
#          Place @ in the name of any animation you want to have play behind
#           it's target.
#          Place NM in the name if FLIP_ANIMATIONS is true and you don't wish
#           an animation to be mirrored.
#        
#Customization: DEFAULT_RATE below for animations without # in their name
#               FLIP_ANIMATIONS is for Side View Battle Systems that don't
#                automatically mirror animations on enemies.
#
#Examples: Sword Slash #3
#          Aura Boost @
#          Combination! #1 @
